# Synthetic Data Generator

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) consist of a method of statistical analysis whose development dates back to Pearson's initial idea (1894) of fitting a mixture of two univariate normal components to a set of measurements of crabs.

Data (univariate or multivariate) > Fit of a GMM > Clusters and statistics

Besides obtaining clusters from univariate or multivariate normal components through the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm, GMM can also be employed for sampling synthetic data.

This is done by considering a GMM with predefined cluster structures and known statistical properties.

# How GMM work?

# The purpose of this repository

Datasets containing clusters with gaussian distribution structures can be very useful for comparing the performance of different algorithms in identifying clusters and their typical or most representative samples, given some clustering quality metrics.

These statistical properties include the mixture proportions (clusters weights), the mean vectors of each component, and their corresponding covariance matrices.
